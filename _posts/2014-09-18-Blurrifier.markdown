```ccode
SELECT a Target of interest
  NAME it Target1

  PUT ASIDE what you know of the Target1
    IGNORE its normal usage;
    IGNORE its role in society

  IMAGINE Target1 as an artwork
    CREATE a title for it;
    THINK about the artist who made it
    PUT AWAY the artwork

  IMAGINE Target1 as an element of a religion
    SPECULATE about the style of the religion;
    IMAGINE a ritual Target1 is included in
    PUT AWAY the religion

  HALF-CLOSE your eyes
    RE-OBSERVE Target1
    RESIST certainty of its meaning;
    LET it change with possibilities
RETURN.

Comment: How to modify Blurrifier
-----------------------

We have earlier mentioned that an advantage of code compared to more rigid approaches you can find in creativity studies, work processes or in self-help literacy. Blurifier is a composition of four smaller functions. That makes it easy to modify. I usually start by refactoring code into functions: 

* .Select_target 
* .ignore_given_meaning, 
* .assign_[target]_as_artwork, 
* .assign_[target]_as_religion and 
* .postpone_return_to_ordinary. 

Once I have done this I either modify a part or add new part and ask “What would make this code more ?interesting? to me?” and “What in this code is currently create most value for me?”

I personally like a lot religion part. I also like the way this code alienate myself from ordinary meanings. Actually, at the moment I’m writing this, the modification to the artwork part is most likely to enhance this code for me. Pretty soon I get idea that I could replace artwork with “scientific tool” or “alien artefact”.

```
IMAGINE Target1 as an alien artefact
```

Next I just tweaked the remaining part of the code fragment, so that it supports as well as possible the idea of alien artefact. Obviously, the title is no more relevant but author can be. I permutated various options in my mind and finally ended up this formulation:

```
IMAGINE Target1 as an alien artefact
                         	THINK about the alien species who have created it
                         	SPECULATE the function of the artefact
                         	TRY to use it; IF it did not work, why?
PUT AWAY the alien artefact
```

Last step is to just try the code with this modification.
