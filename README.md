# Culture Coding website

## How it works

- Website is build on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). Jekyll is Blog-aware engine that generates plain html-site - i.e. there is no server-side logic for rendering pages to user. There is quite a lot of logic for site generation. You can have "master pages" and "pages templates" and you can have reusable components. The pages are either Markdown wiki markup language or html (or both because in Markdown you can use html). In addition to can have arbitraty metadata.
- Responsive layout is build on [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid-example-wrapping)
- CSS is generated by using LESS (mainly because Bootstrap uses LESS)
- CSS and JavaScript minification utilizes Grunt

## Installing development enviroment

In order to produce content you need:

1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/).
2. By default git comes with excelled commandline utility and terrible GUI. If you want to minimize need to
learn new things, I recommend that you use grafical Git utility. There are many free tools, but you can start with GitHub's own GUI choise. Install: [GitHub for Mac](https://mac.github.com/) or [GitHub for Windows](https://windows.github.com/). I have not used these myself, but it seems to be relatively easy to use. If do decide to used GIT commandline utility, great - it's a good choise: once you have learned the basics commandline is
fastest and most flexible way to use git.
3. [Ruby v. 2.0 or newer](http://ruby-lang.com). Notices that the default installation of Ruby is conservatively v. 1.9.x. GitHub pages recommends to use Ruby 2.0+. Depending on the way you may need to installa Ruby development tools; e.g. I installed Ruby to Linux Mint by using apt-get, and I needed to install dev tools in addition. If you use an installation wizard, you probaly can choose to install dev tools.

After this you need to install following Gems (Gem is a Ruby utility library or extensions):

- [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)

Install Jekyll by runing in shell/command prompt: ```gem install jekyll```.

If you get error you probably don't have Ruby development tools installed for the correct version of ruby. Google the error, you probably find out the way to installe them to your OS.

That all. Next you need to get the source codes and say ```jekyll serve``` in the folder the source code are located. Once jekyll dev server is up and running, open broser and got to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

---

If you want to modify styles or write JavaScript logic you need also:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/). Currently, it is used for Css and JavaScript minification and css compilation (LESS). Compliled files are stored to Git, and thus, if you only produce content and need not tweak styles or JavaScript you don't need Node.js.
- Grunt command line utility

Install grunt command line utility after you have installed nodejs but runin in shell/command prompt: ```npm install grunt-cli --global```

## Downloading the source code

If you installed GitHub for your OS, well --- read the getting strated tutorial: [GitHub for Mac help page](https://mac.github.com/help.html) and [GitHub for Windows help page](https://windows.github.com/help.html).

If you chose to use git bash, save you nerves and create first ssh-key for git. GitHub have pretty good [instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/).

Then say:
```
git clone git@github.com:CultureCoding/CultureCoding.github.io.git
```

TODO add link to good git bash tutorial. 

## Modifying and adding pages

- You can add raw html-pages or use markdown-wikisyntax.
- There are two kind of pages in Jekyll: post and pages. The difference is that post needs to have publish page encoded in the title, pages don't. In addition there are quite a lot of Open source plugins for listing post and not that many for listing pages.
- Jekyll have nice collection of simple buildin functions e.f. for page listings and dynamic linking. See [Jekyll documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/)
- You can create reusable components (e.g. navis or banners) and page templates easily. See [templates in Jekyll documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/)
- You can write more complex logic by Ruby. It relatively easy, but you need to know basic of Ruby and understand how Jekyll tags and templates works.
