## What is culture code


_Is Culture Code a language?_

> No, language is a monolithic format for semantic packaging, and such packaging would be rather stiff and cumbersome. Rather, Culture Code modularizes operations from language, which can then be plugged back to language, in any combination.

Culture Code uses conventional languages as its vehicle (something that it jumps in, to be carried) and fuel (something that it can use as semantic material).

Culture Code posits layers, global modifiers, towards language and its usage. These alter the behavior of language from a general perspective, altering its usage.

See [Prefixes](/codes/Prefixes) and an example of the culture codes ability to alter and even go beyond language.

*Is Culture Code yet another mindful excercise?*

> No, excersises are strictly separated from everyday world and they have a predefined goal or target. Culture Code is purpose-neutral: it can convey a purpose alike language but is rather beyond and before a purpose than for a purpose.

Culture Code can be used to create and describe excercises. Thus, sometimes Culture Code is _also_ an excercise. However, it more common that culture code is a layer on awareness and alertness.

## How can I use it

There are three main usage types:

* _Self-usage_
* _Group-usage_
* _System-usage_

Self-usage means that you use it to yourself and others needs to know nothing about the code. Group-usage allows you to define and suggests social patterns, practices and conventions. System-usage allows you to create novel and fertile context for you actions and thought, and craft _system conditions_ that pleases you. The most common use for _system-usage_ are games. Unlike games, Culture Code can be inseparaple from and thightly coupled with everday life.
